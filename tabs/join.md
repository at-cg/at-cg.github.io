# **Hop On**

We are actively on the lookout for bright students and post-docs to join our group and always have open positions! For joining the lab, pre-requisites are (i) strong background in computer science algorithms, data structures, and (ii) programming experience. Prior experience in multi-disciplinary research is a plus. 

### **Prospective graduate students**
Masters and PhD admissions happen based on the [procedures setup by IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/admissions/). This process also involves interview with the [Computational and Data Sciences department](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/admissions/). Occasionally, we also recruit PhD students through the [Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences](http://msci.iisc.ac.in/index.php) program. You can also view the [presentation slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V4ynepWfO8hplcb8Z7PU38B-EqbjdPvC/view?usp=sharing) which we used to introduce our lab to prospective students in May 2022. If you have any questions about the admission process, or our lab in general, you can [email the PI](mailto:chirag@iisc.ac.in).

### **Prospective research staff or post-doctoral researchers**
Please write to the [PI](mailto:chirag@iisc.ac.in) to discuss possibilities. In your email, please specify your background, specific papers or projects that interest you, and a timeline (e.g., ideal start date, intended period of stay). We typically expect commitment of at least an year.
